* REFCARDS

This is a collection of .org files that serve as small reference
cheat-sheets.

** USAGE

Create your own repo containing your custom refcards, or point to
someone elseâ€™s.  I like to keep mine locally at =~/doc/refcards=.

Install [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]].

You can look up any refcard up quickly with =C-h r= by putting this in
your Emacs =init.el=.


#+begin_src elisp
(defun counsel-refcards ()
  "Search local refcards of your own devising."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((default-directory "~/doc/refcards")
         (cands (split-string (shell-command-to-string "ls") nil t)))
    ;; (ivy-read "Topic: " cands :action #'split-window-vertically-balancedly :caller 'counsel-refcards)))
    (ivy-read "Topic: " cands :action #'my-find-file-below)))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h r") 'counsel-refcards)
#+end_src
