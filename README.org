#+TITLE: REFCARDS

This is a collection of .org files that serve as small “reference cards”
(aka cheat-sheets).  Types of cards:

- checklists (process steps)
- cheats-sheets

** USAGE

Create your own repo containing your custom refcards, or point to
someone else’s (like this one!). I like to keep mine locally at
=~/doc/refcards=.

Install [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]].

You can look up any refcard up quickly, from anywhere, with =C-h r= by
putting this in your Emacs =init.el=.


#+begin_src elisp
(defun counsel-refcards ()
  "Search local refcards of your own devising."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((default-directory "~/doc/refcards")
         (cands (split-string (shell-command-to-string "ls") nil t)))
    (ivy-read "Topic: " cands :action #'find-file)))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h r") 'counsel-refcards)
#+end_src
