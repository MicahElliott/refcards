#+title: Hotfix Checklist

It’s Friday afternoon and you’ve done it again.

1. Tell your team channel that the hotfix is needed (add facepalm),
   and that you’re going to have a patch ASAP

1. Create a new Jira (if no one has for you yet), referring to the
   original

1. Create a new branch off the day’s RC (eg: 20201110), not master!

1. Create a PR and get some quick eyes on it

1. Edit the PR to point to the new RC target, not master!

1. Probably should test it now unless totally trivial (right)

1. Discuss with QE lead to confirm it’s high priority, and ensure she
   wants it to go in

1. Merge

1. Announce on release channel that the hotfix is merged (it’ll need
   to be deployed), with reference to the Jira and PR

1. Make another PR to get the change from the RC onto maste
