#+title: Python on Emacs

* python/pyenv (en-py)

Enable pyenv: =en-py=

Enable the appropriate python version: =pyenv=

* poetry

Set up for the virtualenv location that elpy seems to want. On Mac,
this writes to
=/Users/micahelliott/Library/Application Support/pypoetry/config.toml=

#+begin_src shell
poetry config virtualenvs.path /Users/micahelliott/.virtualenvs
#+end_src

Create a project: =poetry new demo=

OR, create a new empty:

#+begin_src shell
mkdir demo
poetry init
#+end_src

* venv

I’m not sure what poetry is using for virtualenvs, but elpy suggests
it wants to use pyvenv. Emacs will complain if you haven’t put your
virtualenvs at =~/.virtualenvs=

* elpy

** Completion
See the comments here to find adding this to =init.el=
https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/30970/11025

#+begin_src elisp
(setq python-shell-completion-native-enable nil)
#+end_src

** REPL

=C-c C-c= to start a REPL. =C-y …= to send chunks to it.
